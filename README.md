# 📱 Numera - Building Math Confidence, One Step At a Time

**Numera** is an AI-driven mobile application that simplifies solving handwritten and printed math problems. Capture an image of any math problem, and Numera will generate step-by-step solutions using state-of-the-art AI models and computational tools. 🚀

## 🧠 Features
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro** for advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to recognize handwritten or printed math problems.
- **LLaMA 3.1 70B** AI agent integrated with **Wolfram Alpha** to compute accurate mathematical solutions. 📊
- Detailed **step-by-step explanations** generated by another **LLaMA 3.1 70B agent**, offering deep insights into problem-solving methods.
- User-friendly interface powered by **React Native** for a seamless experience on mobile devices. 📲

## 🚀 Technology Stack
- **LangChain** - for managing multi-agent orchestration and task delegation. 🤖
- **Together.ai** - for distributed model serving.
- **React Native** - for cross-platform mobile app development. 📱

## 🛠 How it Works
1. **Capture**: Snap a picture of a handwritten or printed math problem using the mobile app. 📸
2. **Recognize**: The image is processed using **Gemini 1.5 Pro**, which extracts the problem text using OCR. ✍️
3. **Solve**: The extracted text is given to AI agent powered by **LLaMA 3.1 70B**, which interacts with **Wolfram Alpha** to compute the solution. 📐
4. **Explain**: The **LLaMA 3.1 70B agent** provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the solution for the user. 📖

## 💡 Use Cases
- **Students**: Get instant help with math homework by capturing math problems and receiving detailed solutions. 🧑‍🎓
- **Teachers**: Use Numera to verify and demonstrate solutions for math problems. 👩‍🏫
- **Lifelong Learners**: Enhance your learning with step-by-step explanations for complex math problems. 🌱
